## üéØ The Problem

Many older adults find it challenging to keep up with modern technology. Essential tasks like paying bills online, sending an email, or using a messaging app can be confusing and intimidating. Saathi was built to be a patient, friendly companion that bridges this gap.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Conversational Text Chat:** A fully functional chat interface that remembers the conversation's context and renders formatted Markdown responses for clarity.
* **Advanced Voice Assistant:** A complete voice-to-voice pipeline. Users can speak their query in English or Hindi and receive step-by-step guidance spoken back by the browser's native voice.
* **Hands-Free Voice Commands:** Once the steps are displayed, users can navigate them using voice commands like "next," "previous," and "repeat" in both English and Hindi, providing a true hands-free experience.
* **Purpose-Driven AI:** The assistant is specifically engineered with prompt guard rails. It is an expert on digital tasks and will politely decline off-topic questions (e.g., general knowledge, trivia) to stay focused on its mission.
* **Smart App Recommendations:** Instead of using technical jargon like "email client," Saathi is instructed to recommend common, popular apps like "Gmail" or "Paytm" to make its advice more actionable.
* **Secure Authentication & History:** Built with Google Firebase for secure and easy user login. All chat conversations are saved to a persistent database and are accessible via a slide-out history panel.
